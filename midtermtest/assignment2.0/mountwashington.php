    <h1>Mount Washington</h1>
    <p>Mount Washington is the highest peak in the Northeast.  It is almost 6,300ft high!  In fact, it is the most
    prominent mountain east of the Mississippi River.  It is a popular tourist destination, both in the winter and
    summer months.  In the winter, people like to hike up with either ski or snowboard down one of the several routes.
    There is a generally a great risk for avalanches, however, so people hike at their own risk.  Three of my friends
    and I took this risk last March and made it to the top of the mountain.  I have never felt so accomplished.
    I took a GoPro video of my ride down, as well as some pictures from the base of the mountain.</p>
