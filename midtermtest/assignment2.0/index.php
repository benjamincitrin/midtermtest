<h1>The Winter</h1>
<p>I chose to go to school in Vermont for a reason--snow.  
    Not only do I just love the snow, but I also love to ski and snowboard. 
I primarily go to Stowe Mountain Resort in Stowe, VT.  However, I have also
hiked and snowboarded down Mount Washington and skied Tuckerman's Ravine.</p>

<p>Tuckerman's Ravine was my favorite snowboard trip by far.  It was my first time
skiing true backcountry and was also very satisfying, since the whole hike took about 5 hours.  
I had to rent snowshoes and strap my snowboard onto a backpack.  After the three mile hike to the base 
of the mountain, it took another two hours to make the steep ascent to the top, after, of course, the four 
of us ignored the very prominent avalanche warnings.</p>
