    <h1>Stowe</h1>
    <p>Stowe
        Mountain Resort is my favorite place to ski on the east coast.  It offers 116 trails and has a 
    wide variety of glades, steep groomers, steep moguls, and an excellent terrain park.  Its lift lines are
    never too long and it is only about forty-five minutes from the University of Vermont campus.  I drive there
    with friends almost every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  This winter has been excellent; we have really enjoyed
    the fresh powder Mother Nature has provided us each week since November.  Below you will see some pictures
    I have taken this year at Stowe.  Some are of the scenic views, while others are of me and my friends enjoying
    ourselves on the terrain.</p>
